        <h3>Personas:</h3>
        <div class="persona">
            <p><b>Alice</b></p>
            <p>Alice, 27, lives alone and works full-time as technician at her local clinic, but needs to take care of her dog. She likes to take him on long walks to 
                keep him happy, but needs to know whether or not the weather will be cooperative and when. She usually accesses the site at night on her phone before 
                setting her alarm for the next morning so that she doesn't wake up early only to see it raining or snowing. During the summers, she can see that it will
                get hot in the afternoon and know to take her dog out before work to avoid the heat.</p><p>She also knows that her dog doesn't do well with groups of 
                strangers, so she also takes note of gatherings and outdoor events that might take place in her town.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="persona">
            <p><b>Albert</b></p>
            <p>Albert, 68, is a retired mechanic who wants to stay healthy enough to play with his grandkids. He knows that using a treadmill would eliminate the problem 
               of weather, but he just doesn't enjoy it if he isn't moving around and going somewhere. He usually checks the site from his desktop computer in the 
               mornings at the same time he checks the news. He doesn't actually mind going for walks in mild precipitation or other generally unpleasant weather, but 
               he wants to make sure he's properly prepared.</p><p>He also likes to attend or at least swing by any events that take place in town, as it gives him an 
               opportunity to socialize while working toward his health goals.</p>
