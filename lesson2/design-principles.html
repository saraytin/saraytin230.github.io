        <h3>Visual Hierarchy</h3>
        <p><strong>5etools</strong></p>
        <a href="http:5e.tools/">5e.tools</a>
        <br>
        <img src="images/5etools.png" alt="screenshot of 5e.tools">
        <p>5etools, a resource for Dungeons and Dragons, uses a combination of proximity, size, and color 
            scheme to create a clear visual hierarchy in their site. As a reference resource, the site's 
            highest priorities are clear presentation and natural navigation, and the sections are grouped 
            and ordered to accomodate how much each section is used. Most users will be players since each
            group has only one game master (GM), so player and general rule resources are placed above 
            those specific to GMs (off-screen below the screenshot area).

        <h3>White Space</h3>
        <p><strong>Smogon</strong></p>

        <img src="images/smogon.png" alt="screenshot of smogon.com pokedex">
        <p>Smogon hosts another game reference, this time aimed toward competitive Pokemon. The page I 
            always navigate from is the table of information on all Pokemon, pictured above. The spacing
            between elements emphasizes readability, but the real efforts in preserving white space show 
            when changing the view width of the window--the number of details on each entry depend on the 
            viewport. Rather than trying to cram information horizontally or expand each row vertically, 
            Smogon determines which columns are necessary and which can be reserved for the linked entry.

    <div class="repetition">
        <h3>Repitition</h3>
        <p><strong>Old School RuneScape</strong></p>
        <a href="http://oldschool.runescape.com">oldschool.runescape.com</a>
        <br>
        <img src="images/osrs.png" alt="screenshot of oldschool.runescape.com">
        <p>The use of repitition on the home page for Old School RuneScape is unconventional, but it 
            is consistent with the selling point of the product itself. The layout is dated and simple, even 
            when removing the "oldschool" in the address shows the modern site for the 
            standard game. This comes from the difference between the two games: RuneScape updates and tries 
            to modernize consistently, but Old School RuneScape intentionally maintains the aesthetic and 
            mechanics of the game's 2007 iteration, banking on simplicity and nostalgia. I could be 
            reading too far into it, but I believe that the simple design that remains static regardless 
            of viewport is a deliberate and effective choice to cater to their audience and playerbase.
